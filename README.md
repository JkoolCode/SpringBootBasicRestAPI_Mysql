# SpringBootBasicRestAPI_Mysql
This is a small and basic REST API based on Client Entity. Also, it's possible to manage a CRUD connected with MYSQL.

You can call:
- Store procedures
- JPA query
- Native SQL query

Moreover, I've been adding features of *Spring Security* for Authorization purpose:
- Generate a JWT encrypted in RSA algorithm (private and public key).
- Accessing resources (endpoints)

In addition, there is a swagger-ui for API Documentation and Test.
