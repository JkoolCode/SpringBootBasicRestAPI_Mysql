# SpringBootBasicRestAPI_Mysql
This is a small and basic REST API based on Client Entity. Also, it's possible to manage a CRUD connected with MYSQL.
In addition, there is a swagger-ui for API Documentation and Test.
Finally, I've been adding features of *Spring Security* for Authorization purpose and accessing resources (endpoints).
